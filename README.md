# Single Layer Neural Network for Iris Dataset Classification

This repository contains Python code implementing a single-layer neural network for classification tasks, demonstrated on the famous Iris dataset. The network is implemented from scratch using NumPy and utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) loss function.

## Files Included

1. `single_layer_nn.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation of the single-layer neural network, including training, testing, and evaluation on the Iris dataset.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the code:

- NumPy: For numerical computations.
- scikit-learn: For dataset loading and train-test splitting.

You can install these dependencies in jupyter notebook using pip:

```
!pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
![NN](https://github.com/hisanusman/Neural-Network-through-Numpy/assets/101946933/e6561598-9db0-45ca-87b6-dc7b8c15e075)
- Note that this is the general concept of the neural networks, and does not related to the jupyter notebook included in this repository as it contains just 1 layer.
  
1. Open and run the `single_layer_nn.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code, including training, testing, and evaluating the single-layer neural network on the Iris dataset.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, containing measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. Each sample consists of four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width), and the goal is to classify each sample into one of the three species.

## Acknowledgments

- The code implementation is inspired by educational resources and tutorials on neural networks and machine learning.
- The Iris dataset is sourced from the scikit-learn library.
